# AI Sales Pipeline Automation

AS6 AI CRM now treats pipeline movement as an approval-controlled AI workflow. The system keeps existing outreach, Telegram, email, AI qualification, follow-ups, and the approval center intact while adding stage recommendations, inactivity detection, risk logging, and AI revenue forecasting.

## Scope and workspace safety

All data paths are scoped by `workspace_id`:

- `crm_leads` stores AI forecast fields per workspace lead.
- `ai_worker_queue` stores `stage_change_recommendation` approval items per workspace.
- `lead_timeline_events` and `crm_activity` log recommendation, approval, stage change, and risk events per workspace.
- CRM stats aggregate only leads that belong to the authenticated user's active workspace.

## Stage recommendation flow

AI may recommend the following controlled transitions:

| Current stage | Recommended stage |
| --- | --- |
| `new` | `qualified` |
| `qualified` | `proposal` |
| `proposal` | `booked` |
| `booked` | `won` or `lost` |

Recommendations are created as `ai_worker_queue.action_type = 'stage_change_recommendation'` with:

- `status = 'pending_approval'`
- `payload.leadId`
- `payload.fromStage` (also mirrored as `currentStatus` for older UI paths)
- `payload.toStage = qualified` for hot/warm AI qualification promotions (also mirrored as `nextStatus`)
- `payload.reason`
- `payload.confidence`
- forecast context such as probability and expected revenue where available

Supported approval statuses are:

- `pending_approval`
- `approved`
- `rejected`
- `executing`
- `executed`
- `failed`
- `cancelled`

For stage recommendations, approval only changes the queue item to `approved`. The manager must then click Execute; execution updates `crm_leads.stage`, stores `executed_at`, and marks the queue item `completed`. This preserves the rule that AI cannot move CRM stages without a human approval and execution action.

## Trigger conditions

Stage recommendations can be generated from:

- Lead replies in Telegram.
- Outreach engagement and inbound response context.
- Email activity, including sent/opened events used in AI scoring context.
- Meeting and demo signals.
- Manual notes and CRM activity.
- Positive intent (`интерес`, `демо`, `стоимость`, `договор`, etc.).
- Negative intent (`не актуально`, `нет бюджета`, `отказ`, etc.).
- AI qualification output and risk/urgency scores: after qualification, a lead gets a `stage_change_recommendation` to `qualified` when `score >= 70` or `temperature = 'hot'`.
- Inactivity/risk signals from follow-up automation.

Example Russian reasons shown in CRM:

- “Клиент подтвердил интерес к демо и запросил детали внедрения.”
- “Лид не отвечает более 7 дней.”
- “Клиент согласовал встречу.”

## Approval center behavior

The approval queue supports the new action type:

```text
stage_change_recommendation
```

Approval writes timeline/audit events:

- `ai_stage_recommendation` when the recommendation is created with text such as “AI рекомендовал перевести лида в стадию Qualified.”
- `ai_action_approved` when a manager approves it.
- `ai_stage_changed` when Execute updates CRM with text such as “Стадия изменена: New → Qualified.”
- `opportunity_risk_detected` when inactivity automation flags risk.

Rejected recommendations remain visible as rejected queue history and do not mutate the CRM lead stage.

## CRM lead modal

The lead detail modal displays an AI Pipeline Automation card when a pending stage recommendation exists:

- Current stage.
- AI recommended stage.
- Reason.
- Confidence.
- Approval status.
- Approve button.
- Reject button.

The generic AI Execution Center still shows outreach, materials, reminders, and other AI actions, but stage recommendations are highlighted separately to make stage movement explicit.

## Inactivity automation and risk detection

The follow-up scanner keeps existing autonomous follow-up behavior and detects:

- `no_reply_24h`
- `no_reply_3d`
- `no_reply_7d`
- `proposal_no_reply`
- `meeting_no_next_step`
- `hot_lead_inactive`

When matched, the scanner generates AI follow-up jobs with reminder/follow-up metadata. High-risk rules additionally log `opportunity_risk_detected` with escalation metadata.

Risk categories include:

- Stalled deal.
- No engagement.
- Repeated ignored follow-ups.
- Weak qualification / low score.

## Revenue forecasting

`crm_leads` now includes AI forecast fields:

- `probability_to_close`
- `estimated_revenue`
- `expected_close_date`

AI lead scoring updates these fields from `deal_probability` and current deal value. Dashboard stats calculate forecasted revenue from explicit lead forecast fields first, then fall back to latest AI score probability.

## Dashboard metrics

The dashboard exposes:

- AI forecasted revenue.
- Deals at risk.
- Inactive opportunities.
- AI stage recommendations pending.
- Pipeline health percentage.

These metrics are returned in `stats.aiMetrics` and remain workspace-scoped.

## Verification scenario

1. Create a CRM lead.
2. Approve outreach draft as before.
3. Simulate or receive a Telegram reply with positive intent, such as asking for a demo or implementation details.
4. AI creates a `stage_change_recommendation` queue item with `leadId`, `fromStage`, `toStage = qualified`, `confidence`, and `reason`.
5. Open the lead modal or AI Approval Center and review from stage, to stage, confidence, and reason.
6. Approve the recommendation.
7. Click Execute.
8. CRM updates `crm_leads.stage` to `qualified`, the queue item becomes `completed` with `executed_at`, and timeline shows recommendation, approval, and `ai_stage_changed` events.

## Deployment
